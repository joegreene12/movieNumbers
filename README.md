Project #3: Building My Own API

Using Sinatra to build an API on Movies and the financial figures. The interest in finding out the top movies according to budgets.

Ideation: The content my API holds within a single model are movie name, movie release year, production budget, and world wide gross all inside one table.

As of this stage of the project, security for API through authentication will be through an API.

Outside sources such as OMDB and the-numbers.com have existing APIs but are limited with access. This project will improve upon the existing APIs currently available after certain requirements are met.

Researching how to enable CORS (Cross Origin Requests) is still a process. The initial plan is to use a gem such as sinatra-cross-origin in able to give the permission/access when the client side is making a requests such as an ajax call which would automatically use the preflight info.

Explanations of the technologies used are:
HTML5 CSS Javascript jQuery Ruby on Rails Postgres SQL Active Record Backbone PG Commander


A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took

Installation instructions for any dependencies

Link to your user stories – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
Keep user stories small and well-defined, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.

Link to your wireframes – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application

Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome. You may not complete everything and that is okay. Tell us what you have left to do for version 2.0.

There were some challenges that had to be overcome as using Backbone.js for the first time was a major step personally in web development. Also, there were many debugging issues that did not seem
like a big deal, but it was. I had difficulty with choosing which way to go about api authentication.
Syntax with identifying classes.
